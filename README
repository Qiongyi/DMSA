DMSA

Analysis pipeline for the identification of DNA differentially methylated sites between two groups for MeDIP-Seq (Illumina paired-end reads) with multiple biological replicates in each condition/group.

Usage for scripts in DMSA pipeline:
1) Get_properly_mapping_stats.pl
	Usage: perl Get_properly_mapping_stats.pl input1 input2 output
	
	Input1 is a list of chromosome names (eg. chr1, chr2, chrX, chrM, etc.), each chromosome per line.
	Input2 is the ".sam" file generated by BWA
	Output file is the summary of total number of reads, properly paired-end mapped reads, Properly paired-end mapped reads with good mapping quality (Q>=20) and mapping stats based on each chromosome.  

2) Map_Q20_sam.pl

3) Summary_stats.pl

4) MACS_1GetPeakSummits.pl

5) MACS_2ReadCount_BinarySearch.pl

6) MACS_3TTest.pl

7) MACS_4group_peaks.pl
